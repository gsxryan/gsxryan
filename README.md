## Hi, thanks for visiting üëã


Some of my favorite tasks are Software deployment, patch management, system provisioning, desired state, Powershell, Docker, and other infrastructure as code.

I'm currently learning Ansible, Terraform, Intune, PSADT, Proxmox Clustering and Kubernetes in my HomeLab.


"Powershell-Scripts" is the strongest featured repo available.  Containing many Sys and SecOps optimization examples for use in accelerating T2 and System Administrator workflows.


Private Repo Coming soon... A cloud based application that crawls all local shortcuts, adding the abillity to centralize orchestration to inject custom code on launch, enabling custom functionality, and telemetry.
  This will be helpful in communicating custom software actions to end users, and auditing how often items are used to evalute for end-of-life actions.
