## Hi, thanks for visiting üëã


Some of my favorite tasks are Software deployment, patch management, system provisioning, desired state, Powershell, Docker, and other infrastructure as code.

I'm currently learning Ansible, Terraform, Intune, PSADT, Proxmox Clustering and Kubernetes in my HomeLab.


"Powershell-Scripts" is the strongest featured repo available.  Containing many Sys and SecOps optimization examples for use in accelerating T2 and System Administrator workflows.
As you explore, keep in mind much of the code here was created in a very fast paced environment with little emphasis on form, and extreme emphasis on function, and keeping costs low.
Effective early 2025 99% of the code here is all home-grown from scratch.  If code is refactored elsewhere, fork credit it given, or references are mentioned at the top commments section.  

Private Repos Coming soon... More Ansible Scripts Orchestrating Unifi WPAsupplicant bypass.  A cloud based application that crawls all local shortcuts, adding the abillity to centralize orchestration to inject custom code on launch, enabling custom functionality, and telemetry.  Adding screenshots to highlight scripts functionality.  A mobile SD-WAN solution for live streaming out AFK.
